        <h2><u>About Sun:</u></h2>
        <p>The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p>

        <h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
        <p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.</p>
        <h2><u>Ten Things to Know About the Sun</u></h2>
        <ol type="1">
             <li>The Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet. If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be about the size of a nickel.</li>
             <li>The Sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it – the planets, asteroids, comets, and tiny bits of space debris.</li>
             <li>Measuring a “day” on the Sun is complicated because of the way it rotates. It doesn't spin as a single, solid ball. This is because the Sun’s surface isn't solid like Earth's. Instead, the Sun is made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</li>
             <li>The part of the Sun we see from Earth – the part we call the surface – is the photosphere. The Sun doesn’t actually have a solid surface because it’s a ball of plasma.</li>
             <li>Above the Sun’s surface are its thin chromosphere and the huge corona (crown). This is where we see features such as solar prominences, flares, and coronal mass ejections. The latter two are giant explosions of energy and particles that can reach Earth.</li>
             <li>The Sun doesn’t have moons, but it’s orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and perhaps three trillion comets and icy bodies.</li>
             <li>Several spacecraft are currently investigating the Sun including Parker Solar Probe, STEREO, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, IRIS, and Wind.</li>

             <li>Nothing could live on the Sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.</li>
             <li>The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) – hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><u>Pop Culture</u></h2>
        <p>The Sun has inspired us since ancient times. It’s central to mythology and religion in cultures around the world, including the ancient Egyptians, the Aztecs of Mexico, Native American tribes of North and South America, the Chinese, and many others.

          The Sun in Time
          Countless musicians have written songs about the Sun. The Beatles had a hit in 1969 with “Here Comes the Sun.” Other popular songs that reference the Sun include: “Walkin’ on the Sun” by Smashmouth; “Ain’t No Sunshine” by Bill Withers; “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves; “Pocketful of Sunshine” by Natasha Bedingfield; and “Let the Sunshine In” by the Fifth Dimension.
          
          If you're Superman or a fellow Kryptonian, your powers are heightened by the yellow glow of our Sun, and you can even dispose of dangerous materials, as Superman and Superboy did, by hurling them into the Sun.
          
          In the 1990 science fiction film “Solar Crisis,” a huge solar flare is about to scorch Earth. Astronauts are supposed to use a bomb to divert the flare. In the 2007 film “Sunshine,” the Sun is dying, plummeting Earth into a deep freeze. To save humanity, astronauts try to reignite the Sun with a bomb, though things don't quite go as planned. In the 2019 film “The Wandering Earth,” once again the Sun is dying, but there’s no bomb this time. Instead, people build giant rocket thrusters to move the Earth to a new star system. (Like all stars, the Sun will eventually run out of energy – but scientists don’t expect this to happen for another 5 billion years or so.)

          <p>NASA studies the Sun, and how it influences the very nature of space — and, in turn, the atmospheres of planets and the technology that exists there. 

            Space is not, as is often believed, completely empty; instead, we live in the extended atmosphere of an active star. Our Sun sends out a steady outpouring of particles and energy -- the solar wind – as well as a constantly writhing magnetic system. This extensive, dynamic solar atmosphere surrounds the Sun, Earth, the planets, and extends far out into the solar system.
            
            Studying this system not only helps us understand fundamental information about how the universe works, but also helps protect our technology and astronauts in space. NASA seeks knowledge of near-Earth space, because -- when extreme -- space weather can interfere with our communications, satellites and power grids. The study of the Sun and space can also teach us more about how stars contribute to the habitability of planets throughout the universe.
            
            Mapping out this interconnected system requires a holistic study of a giant system spread throughout the solar system.  NASA has a fleet of spacecraft strategically placed throughout our heliosphere -- from Parker Solar Probe at the Sun observing the very start of the solar wind, to satellites around Earth, to the farthest human-made object, Voyager, which is sending back observations on interstellar space. Each mission is positioned at a critical, well-thought out vantage point to observe and understand the flow of energy and particles throughout the solar system -- all helping us untangle the effects of the star we live with. 
            
            NASA's areas of heliophysics study include: 
            
            Solar Science
            The Sun is a dynamic star, just like the other stars in the sky -- but our star is the only one we can study up close, helping us to understand other stars throughout the universe. This star we live with is, of course, constantly affecting Earth. Not only does the Sun provide our planet with light and heat, but it also sends out a constant flow of particles, energy, and magnetic fields called the solar wind. The solar wind fills up space around the planets and extends far past Neptune. NASA studies the Sun and the solar wind for several reasons: changes in the space environment near Earth can interfere with technology in space; the space environment around planets -- whether it’s Earth, a planet in the solar system or an exoplanet -- can influence whether it is habitable for life to form or evolve; and the more we understand this dynamic space environment near home, the more we can understand it elsewhere.  
            
            Space Weather
            The Sun’s constant outflow of solar wind fills space with a thin and tenuous wash of particles, magnetic fields and plasma. This solar wind, along with other solar events like giant explosions called coronal mass ejections, influences the very nature of space and can interact with the magnetic systems of Earth and other worlds. Such effects also change the radiation environment through which our spacecraft – and, one day, our astronauts headed to the Moon and to Mars – travel.  Such space weather can interfere with satellite electronics, communications and GPS signals, and even – when extreme – utility grids on Earth.  NASA serves as the research arm of the nation’s space weather program, helping to better understand what the causes and effects of space weather. 
            
            Magnetospheres
            The magnetosphere is a bubble of magnetic fields that surrounds Earth, created by the natural magnetism of the planet. The magnetosphere protects humans on Earth from incoming energy from the Sun, but it also changes shape and size in response to such space weather . These fluctuations can degrade communication signals and cause unexpected electrical surges in power grids. NASA studies the magnetosphere to better understand its role in our space environment. By studying this space environment close to home, we can better understand the nature of space throughout the universe. Such research helps unravel the fundamental physics of space, which is dominated by complex electromagnetic interactions unlike what we experience day-to-day on Earth.
            
            Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere and mesosphere
            NASA also studies the ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere layers of the atmosphere -- the layers where aurora and other space weather events manifest. The ionosphere is a layer in Earth's atmosphere that extends from about 50 to 300 miles above the surface of the planet. The layer is filled with electrically charged particles and overlaps with the neutral particles of the mesosphere and thermosphere. The ionosphere is sensitive both to incoming material from the Sun, and to terrestrial weather rising up from below -- creating a complex and challenging system to understand. Since the ionosphere is home to low Earth-orbiting spacecraft, as well as the region of space through which radio communications travel, unexpected changes in the region can have a dramatic effect on human technology. 
            
            Our heliosphere
            The solar wind ultimately travels past all the planets, extending out three times the distance to Pluto before being impeded by the interstellar medium. This forms a giant bubble around the Sun and its planets, known as the heliosphere. NASA studies the heliosphere to better understand the fundamental physics of the space surrounding us -- which, in turn, teaches us more about the nature of space throughout the rest of the universe, as well as regarding how it drives planetary atmospheres that contribute to planet habitability.
